# HeatMaps
Proyect for create a haeat maps whit Folium

Hi EveryBody


The objective of this project is to visualize points of interest on an interactive map 
based on classic coordinates of latitude and longitude using different techniques, 
from standard markers, points to heat maps in urban perimeters.

The central point is to make small adjustments to your the database, in order to get 
it ready and after that implement the Folium library: https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/ 
this project is presented as a great alternative to the classic GIS libraries such as GeoPandas, 
Argis Web Package or others, to implement in the workflow of maps and this type of project.

Enyoy :)
